## Time Series 

**Course Description** (from the syllabus):  This course provided an introduction to modern time series econometrics. The first part of the course dealt with properties of dependent processes. This includes laws of large numbers and central limit theorems as well as the Wold Representation, and the properties of autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and ARMA processes. The course also included a brief excursion into the frequency domain where we studied the spectrum and its approximation. The second part focuses on statistical inference. We begin with the Bayesian estimation of AR models. Then we considered the analysis of linear state-space models, which encompass ARMA models, time-varying coefficient models, and factor models. Finally, we considered models with time-varying heteroskedasticity and extensions to vector processes.

## Stochastic Processes

**Course Description** (from the syllabus): The goal of this course was to lay the foundation for the mastery of the technology of basic stochastic processes. We will studied some essential processes such as Markov chains, Poisson Processes, Branching Processes, Renewal Processes, and some of the methodology of martingales. The focus was on the development of mathematical skills and the understanding of key theoretical concepts, but some simple applications to areas such as finance, statistics, or machine learning were also be discussed.
